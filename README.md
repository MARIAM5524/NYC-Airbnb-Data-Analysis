# NYC-Airbnb-Data-Analysis
The first interactive dashboard I created using Excel. This dashboard provides detailed analytics on number of reviews, quantities, and prices based on room type, neighborhood group, and neighborhood.


Data:
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019.

This data contains 16 columns, 47905 unique values(samples).

Data cleaning:
I removed unnecessary duplicate data from the dataset and eliminated irrelevant data such as the last review, as it does not support the required analysis. I filled the necessary null values with zero and removed the unnecessary null values. Finally, I performed the visualization using Excel.
